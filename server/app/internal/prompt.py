RULES = {
    "product": {
    "Clarity and Readability": """
    The product description should be easy to understand and written in natural, fluent language. Avoid overly complex or ambiguous phrasing. Sentences should flow logically and avoid redundancy.
    """,
    "Brand Tone and Storytelling": """
    Descriptions should reflect the brand’s personality: colorful, ocean-themed, friendly, and informative. Use storytelling to highlight the uniqueness of the species or the meaning behind the illustration.
    """,
    "SEO Keywords": """
    Include relevant keywords a user might search for, such as the product name, animal featured, or usage scenario. However, avoid keyword stuffing — keywords should appear naturally in the text.
    """,
    "Persuasiveness": """
    Descriptions should entice potential buyers by emphasizing selling points such as functionality, material, uniqueness, or gift value. Highlight why this product is a good choice.
    """,
    "Structure and Formatting": """
    Use clear structure, such as short paragraphs or bullet points for features (e.g., size, material, care instructions). This improves scan-ability and user experience on e-commerce platforms.
    """,
    },
    "marketing": {
        "Opening Hook": """
        The first 1–2 lines of an Instagram caption are the most visible. Begin with a strong hook, question, or key message to catch attention. This can include emojis, hashtags, or formatting to highlight the main idea.
    """,
    "Main Body Relevance": """
        The body of the caption should match the post content. It can be short and fun (for product launches or promotions) or longer and informative (for storytelling or educational posts). Maintain consistency with brand tone and purpose.
    """,
    "Emoji Usage": """
        Emojis can help express emotion and improve readability. Use them to enhance the message and break up text, but avoid overuse, which may clutter the post or distract from the message.
    """,
    "Hashtag Strategy": """
        Include 3 to 10 relevant hashtags. Avoid unrelated or repetitive tags. Hashtags should reflect the topic, brand, or campaign, and aim to boost discoverability without overwhelming the caption.
    """,
    "Tone and Brand Voice": """
        The tone should reflect the brand’s identity: colorful, ocean-inspired, a mix of educational and playful. Avoid sounding generic or too formal. Maintain consistency across posts.
    """,
    "Language Quality": """
        Captions should be free of spelling or grammar mistakes. Avoid awkward phrasing, overused cliches, or confusing sentence structure.
